# Docker
## What is DOCKER?
- Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. 
- Docker is an open source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers

- A developer will define all the applications and its dependencies and its requirements which is called as **Docker File**.
- Docker File can be used to create **Docker Images**
- When we run docker image, we will get **Docker Containers**. So docker containers are the run time instances of docker image and these images can also be stored in an online cloud repositories which is **Docker Hub**
- In **Docker Hub** , there are many publicly available images and you can store your own docker images as well. 
- This image can be pulled to any environment like staging environment or test environment.
